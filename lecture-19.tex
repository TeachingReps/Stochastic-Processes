\maketitle

\noindent {\bf Recall:} A stochastic process $\{X(t) \in I: t \in T\}$ (where $T = \R$ or $T = \Z$) is \textbf{reversible} if $(X(t_i): i \in [n])$ has the same distribution as $(X(\tau-t_i): i \in [n])$ for all $t_i, \tau \in T, i \in [n]$. In general, we can ask -- what does the time-reversed version of a stochastic process look like?

\section{Reversed Processes}
%\begin{defn} 
Let $\{X(t)\}_{t \in T}$ be a stochastic process (here $T$ will be either $\R$ or $\Z$). We call $\{X(\tau-t)\}_{t \in T}$ the {\em reversed process}, for some $\tau \in T$.
%\end{defn}
\begin{lem} 
If $\{X(t)\}_{t \in \Z}$ is a Markov chain, then the reversed process $\{X(\tau -t)\}_{t \in \Z}$ is also a Markov chain.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} For each $m \in \Z$, let $\F_m = \sigma \left(\cup_{k \geq m} X_k\right)$ represent the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the random variables $\{X_k: k \geq m\}$. Then, we can write
\begin{align*}
\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j,\F_{m+1}\} %&= \frac{\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j, \F_{m+1} \}}{\Pr\{X_m=j, \F_{m+1}\}}\\
&=\frac{\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j\}\Pr\{\F_{m+1} |X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j \}}{\Pr\{\F_{m+1} |X_m=j\}}.
\end{align*}
Using the Markov property of $X(t)$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
\Pr\{\F_{m+1} |X_m= j, X_{m-1} = i \} &=\Pr\{\F_{m+1}|X_m=j\},
\end{align*}
thus implies $\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j,\F_{m+1}\} = \Pr\{X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j\}$, showing that the reversed process is indeed a Markov chain. 
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
Even if the forward process $X$ is time-homogeneous, the reversed process need not be time-homogeneous. 
\end{rem}


\begin{lem}  If $\{X(t)\}_{t \in \Z}$ is a stationary, time homogeneous Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ and equilibrium distribution $\alpha$, then the reversed chain $\{X(\tau -t)\}_{t \in \Z}$ is a stationary, time homogeneous Markov chain with the same equilibrium distribution $\alpha$, and transition matrix $P^{\ast}$ given by
\begin{align*}
P^{\ast}_{ij} = \frac{\alpha_j}{\alpha_i}P_{ji}.
\end{align*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} 
It is clear that the reversed chain must have the same stationary distribution $\alpha$. For computing its transition matrix, use Bayes' formula to get
\begin{align*}
\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j\} &= \frac{\Pr\{X_{m-1}=i\} \, P_{ij}  }{ \Pr\{X_{m}=j\} } =\frac{\alpha_i \, P_{ij}  }{ \alpha_j },
\end{align*}
yielding the desired result. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} 
If $X(t)$ is a stationary Markov process with generator matrix $Q$ and equilibrium distribution $\pi$, then the reversed process $X(\tau -t)$ is a stationary Markov process with same equilibrium distribution $\pi$ and generator matrix $Q^{\ast}$ such that
\begin{align*}
Q^{\ast}_{ij} = \frac{\pi_j}{\pi_i}Q_{ji}.
\end{align*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} 
Follows from calculations analogous to those in the previous result. 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Examples of reversible processes}
\begin{shaded*}
%\begin{exmp}[An Ergodic Random Walk] 
%Any ergodic, positive recurrent random walk is time reversible. 
%The transition probability satisfy the following equation for each $i \in \Z$
%\eq{
%P_{i,i+1}+P_{i,i-1}=1.
%} For every $n$ transitions from $i+1$ to $i$, there must be at least $n-1$ or at most $n+1$ transitions from $i$ to $i+1$. 
%The rate of transitions from $i+1$ to $i$ must hence be same as the number of transitions from $i$ to $i+1$. 
%It follows that, the process is time reversible.
%\end{exmp}
\begin{exmp}[Birth-death processes]
\begin{defn}
A Markov process $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ on the state space $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ is called a {\em birth-death process} if its infinitesimal transition probabilities satisfy
\[ P_{n,n+m}(h) = \left\{
   \begin{array}{ll} % brackets may be (...), [...], \{...\}, or left out
      \lambda_n h + o(h), & \text{if } m = 1, \\
      \mu_n h + o(h), & \text{if } m = -1, \\
      o(h), & \text{if } |m| > 1, 
   \end{array}\right.
\]
for some nonnegative numbers $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \ldots$ (`birth rates') and $\mu_0, \mu_1, \ldots$ (`death rates'). \\
({\bf Note.} We say $f(h) = o(h)$ if $\lim_{h \to 0} f(h)/h = 0$.)
\end{defn}
In other words, a birth-death process is any CTMC with generator of the form 
\[ 
   Q = \left( \begin{array}{cccccc} % brackets may be (...), [...], \{...\}, or left out
      -\lambda_0 & \lambda_0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      \mu_1 & -(\lambda_1 + \mu_1) & \lambda_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots\\
      0 & \mu_2 & -(\lambda_2 + \mu_2) & \lambda_2 & 0 & \cdots\\
      0 & 0 & \mu_3 & -(\lambda_3 + \mu_3) & \lambda_3 & \cdots \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  & \ddots
   \end{array} \right).
\]
\end{exmp}
\end{shaded*}

\begin{prop}
An ergodic birth-death process in steady-state is time-reversible.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
%To prove the above, we must show that the rate at which the process goes from state $i$ to $i+1$ is equal to the rate of going from $i+1$ to $i$. 
%However, during any time interval of length $t$, the number of transitions from $i$ to $i+1$ should be within $1$ of the number of transitions from $i+1$ to $i$ (since the process is birth and death process. 
%Hence, as $t \to \infty$,  both rates will be equal. 
Since the process is stationary, the probability flux must balance across any cut of the form $A = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, i\}$, $i \geq 0$ (Lemma \ref{lem:fluxbalance}). But this is precisely the equation $\pi_i \lambda_i = \pi_j \mu_j$ since there are no other transitions possible across the cut. So the process is time-reversible. 
\end{proof}

In fact, the following, more general, statement can be proven using similar ideas. 

\begin{prop}
Consider an ergodic CTMC on a countable state space $I$ with the following property: for any pair of states $i \neq j \in I$, there is a {\em unique} path $i = i_0 \to i_1 \to \cdots \to i_{n(i,j)} = j$ of distinct states having positive probability. Then the CTMC in steady-state is reversible. 
\end{prop}

\begin{shaded*}
\begin{exmp}[Truncated CTMCs]

%\begin{cor}
%Consider an M/M/s queue with Poisson$(\lambda)$ arrivals and each server having exponential service time $\exp(\mu)$ service. If $\lambda > s \mu$, then the output process in steady state is Poisson$(\lambda)$.
%\end{cor}
%\begin{proof}
%Let $X(t)$ denote the number of customers in the system at time $t$. Since M/M/s process is a birth and death process, it follows from the previous proposition that $\{X(t),~t \geq 0\}$ is time reversible. Now going forward in time, the time instants at which $X(t)$ increases by 1 are the arrival instants of a Poisson process. Hence, by time reversibility, the time Points at which $X(t)$ increases by 1 when we go backwards in time also constitutes a Poisson process. But these instants are exactly the departure instants of the forward process. Hence the result.
%\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
Consider a transition rate matrix $(Q_{ij})_{i, j \in I}$ on the countable state space $I$. Given a nonempty subset $A \subseteq I$, the truncation of $Q$ to $A$ is the transition rate matrix $(Q^A_{ij})_{i, j \in A}$, where $\forall i, j \in A$
\[ Q^A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
Q_{ij}, & j \neq i, \\
-\sum_{k \neq i, k \in A} Q_{ik}, &  j = i.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
Suppose $(X_t)_{t \in \R}$ is an irreducible, time-reversible CTMC on the countable state space $I$, with generator $Q \equiv (Q_{ij})_{i, j \in I}$ and stationary probabilities $\pi_j,~ j \in I$. Suppose the truncation $Q^A$ is irreducible for some $A \subseteq I$. Then, any stationary CTMC with state space $A$ and generator $Q^A$ is also time-reversible, with stationary probabilities
\begin{align*}
\pi_j^A&=\frac{\pi_j}{\sum_{i \in A}\pi_i},~ j \in A.
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We must show that 
\begin{align*}
\pi_i^AQ_{ij}&=\pi_j^AQ_{ji},~ i \in A,~ j \in A,
\end{align*}
or equivalently,
\begin{align*} 
\pi_iQ_{ij}&=\pi_jQ_{ji},~ i \in A,~ j \in A.
\end{align*}
But this is true as the original chain is time reversible.
\end{proof}

\end{exmp}

\begin{shaded*}
\begin{exmp}[The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm] Let $\{a_j \in \R_+,~ j \in [m]\}$ be a set of (known) positive numbers with $A=\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i$. 
Suppose our goal is to build a sampler for a random variable with probability mass function $\pi_j = \frac{a_j}{A}$ $j \in [m]$, where  $m$ is large and $A$ is difficult to compute directly (this rules out evaluating the fraction $\frac{a_j}{A}$). 

%To generate such a sequence of random variables whose distribution converges to $\pi$, we simulate a Markov chain whose limiting probabilities are $\pi$. 
%The Metropolis algorithm provides a convenient approach. 
{\bf Idea.} A clever way of (approximately) generating a sample from the distribution $\pi \equiv (\pi_j)_{j \geq 1}$ is by constructing an easy-to-simulate Markov chain with limiting (stationary) distribution $\pi$. We simply run this Markov chain long enough and return the sample (state) at the end.  

Let $M$ be an irreducible transition probability matrix on the integers $[m]$ such that $M = M^T$ (an example is the transition matrix of an iid sequence of uniform random variables on $[m]$). 
Consider the Markov chain $\{X_i: i \in \N\}$ on the state space $[m]$ with the following transition probabilities:
\begin{align*}
P_{ij} = \begin{cases}
       M_{ij} \, \min\left(1,\frac{a_j}{a_i}\right), & j \neq i,\\
       1 - \sum_{k \neq i}Q_{ik}\left\{1-\min\left(1,\frac{a_k}{a_i}\right)\right\}, & j = i.
     \end{cases}
\end{align*} 
Note that the key property that allows us to easily simulate this Markov chain is that only the relative ratios $a_j/a_i$ are required, and not $A$!

It can be directly verified that (1) this Markov chain is irreducible, and that (2) it is reversible with equilibrium distribution $\pi$!

\begin{exmp}[Random walks on edge-weighted graphs] Consider an undirected graph $G$ with vertex set $I$ and edge set $E$, i.e., $G = (I, E)$, with $E$ a subset of unordered pairs of elements from $I$. Assume having a positive number $w_{ij}$ associated with each edge $(i,j)$ in $E$, and suppose that a particle moves from vertex to vertex, in discrete time, in the following manner: If the particle is presently at vertex  $i$ then it will next move to vertex $j$ with probability
\begin{equation*}
P_{ij}=\frac{w_{ij}}{\sum_{j}w_{ij}},
\end{equation*}
where $w_{ij}$ is defined to be 0 if $(i,j)$ is not an edge of the graph. The Markov chain describing the sequence of vertices visited by the particle is a random walk on an undirected edge-weighted graph. 
\end{exmp}
\begin{note}
Google's PageRank algorithm, to estimate the relative importance of webpages, is essentially a random walk on a graph!
\end{note}

\end{shaded*}

\begin{prop}
Consider a random walk on an edge weighted graph with a finite number of vertices. If this Markov chain is irreducible, then it is, in steady state, time reversible with stationary probabilities given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:graphrwstationarydist}
\pi_i = \frac{\sum_{j}w_{ij}}{\sum_{j}\sum_{k}w_{kj}}, \quad \forall i \in I.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
For each $i, j \in I$, the detailed balance equation
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_iP_{ij}=\alpha_{j}P_{ji}
\end{equation*}
reduces to 
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{\alpha_i w_{ij}}{\sum_{k}w_{ik}}=\frac{\alpha_j w_{ji}}{\sum_{k}w_{jk}}
\end{equation*}
But noting that $w_{ij}=w_{ji}$, we see that $\pi$ defined as in (\ref{eqn:graphrwstationarydist}) solves the equation, and we get the desired result.
\end{proof}

%\begin{exmp}[Random walks on graphs]
%
%%\begin{defn}
%Consider a finite graph $G = (I, E)$, $|I| < \infty$, $E \subseteq I \times I$, with a nonnegative edge weight for each edge, $w: E \to \R_+$. 
%We can consider a (discrete time) random walk on this graph, with the state being the location of a single particle on one of the nodes of this graph. 
%For any node $i \in I$, we can define the set of incoming and outgoing edges as 
%\begin{xalignat*}{3}
%&H_{i} = \{(j,i) \in E: j \in I\},&&F_i = \{(i,j) \in E: j \in I\}.
%\end{xalignat*}
%The probability of the particle moving from node $i$ to node $j$ in a single unit of time is defined by 
%\begin{align*}
%P_{ij} = \begin{cases}
%\frac{w_{i,j}}{\sum_{f \in F_i}w_{f}}, & (i,j) \in E, \\
%0, & (i,j) \notin E.
%\end{cases}
%\end{align*}
%The Markov chain $\{X(n) \in I: n \in \N\}$, with the above transition probability matrix, describing the sequence of vertices visited by the particle is called a \textbf{random walk on an edge-weighted graph}. 
%%The associated transition matrix for each $i,j \in I$ is 
%%\eq{
%%P_{ij} &= P_e.

The following `dual' result also holds:

\begin{lem} 
Let $\{X\}_n$ be a reversible Markov chain on a finite state space $I$ and transition probability matrix $P$. Then, there exists a random walk on a weighted, undirected graph $G$ with the same transition probability matrix $P$. 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof} 
We create a graph $G = (I,E)$, where $(i,j) \in E$ if and only if $P_{ij} > 0$. We then set edge weights 
\begin{align*}
w_{ij} \triangleq \pi_i P_{ij} = \pi_jP_{ji} = w_{ji},
\end{align*}
where $\pi$ is the stationary distribution of $X$. With this choice of weights, it is easy to check that $w_i = \sum_j w_{ij} = \pi_i$, and the transition matrix associated with a random walk on this graph is exactly $P$.
\end{proof}


%%The sequence $\{X_n,X_{n-1} \hdots \}$ is called reverse process. Let $P^*$ denote the transition probability matrix. 
%%\begin{align*}
%%P_{ij}^*&=P(X_{n-1}=j|X_n=i)=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j,X_n=i)}{P(X_n=i)}\\
%%&=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j)P(X_n=i|X_{n-1}=j)}{P(X_{n}=i)}\\
%%&=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j)}{P(X_{n}=i)}P_{ji}

%%suppose we are considering a stationary Markov chain, $P(X_n=l)=P(X_{n-1}=l)=\alpha(l),~\forall l$, $\alpha(i){P^*}_{ij}=\alpha(j)(P)_{ji}$. 
%\begin{lem} A stationary Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ is reversible if the reversed process follows the same probabilistic law as the original process, i.e. $P^*= P$. Any non-negative vector $\alpha$ satisfying $\alpha_iP_{ij}=\alpha_jP_{ji},~\forall i,j \in I$ and $\sum_{j \in I}\alpha_j=1$ is stationary distribution of this Markov chain.

%
%It is clear that $\pi$ is an equilibrium distribution of forward Markov process, since

%\end{proof}


%\subsection{Time Reversibility of Discrete Time Markov Chains}
%Consider a discrete time Markov chain with transition probability matrix $P$ and stationary probability vector $\alpha$.\\
%\textbf{Claim:} The reversed process is a Markov chain.
%\begin{proof}
%\begin{align*}
%&P(X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j,X_{m+1}=i_{m+1} \hdots )=\frac{P(X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j, \hdots )}{P(X_m=j, X_{m+1}=i_{m+1}\hdots )}\\
%&=\frac{P(X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j)P(X_{m+1}=i_{m+1}\hdots |X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j  )}{P(X_m=j)P(X_{m+1}=i_{m+1} \hdots |X_m=j)}\\
%&\stackrel{(a)}{=}\frac{P(X_{m-1}=i,X_m=j)P(X_{m+1}=i_{m+1}\hdots |X_m=j  )}{P(X_m=j)P(X_{m+1}=i_{m+1} \hdots |X_m=j)}\\
%&=P(X_{m-1}=i|X_m=j).\\
%\end{align*}
%where $(a)$ follows from the Markov property.
%\end{proof}
%The sequence $\{X_n,X_{n-1} \hdots \}$ is called reverse process. Let $P^*$ denote the transition probability matrix. 
%\begin{align*}
%P_{ij}^*&=P(X_{n-1}=j|X_n=i)=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j,X_n=i)}{P(X_n=i)}\\
%&=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j)P(X_n=i|X_{n-1}=j)}{P(X_{n}=i)}\\
%&=\frac{P(X_{n-1}=j)}{P(X_{n}=i)}P_{ji}
%\end{align*}
%suppose we are considering a stationary Markov chain, $P(X_n=l)=P(X_{n-1}=l)=\alpha(l),~\forall l$, $\alpha(i){P^*}_{ij}=\alpha(j)(P)_{ji}$. If $P^*=P^T$ then the Markov chain is called time reversible. Thus the condition for time reversibility is given by $\alpha P_{ij}=\alpha_jP_{ji}$. Any non-negative vector $X$ satisfying $X_iP_{ij}=X_jP_{ji},~\forall i,j$ and $\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_0}X_j=1$ is stationary distribution of time-reversible Markov chain. This is true because,
%\begin{align*}
%\sum_{i} X_i P_{ij}=\sum_i X_j P_{ji}=X_j \sum X_i = 1.
%\end{align*}
%Since stationary probabilities are the unique solution of the above, the claim follows.\\



\subsection{Example 4.7(E): Example 4.3(C) revisited}
Example 4.3(C) was with regard to the age of a renewal process. $X_n$ the forward process there was such that it increases in steps of 1 until it hits a value chosen by the inter arrival distribution. Hence the reverse process should be such that it decreases in steps of 1 until it hits 1 and then jumps to a state as chosen by the inter arrival distribution. Thus letting $\pi_i$ as the probability of inter arrival, it seems likely that  $P_{1i}*=\pi_i, ~ P_{i,i-1}=1,~ i > 1$. We have that $P_{i,1}=\frac{\pi_i}{\sum_{j \geq 1}\pi_j}=1-P_{i,i+1}, ~ i \geq 1$. For the reversed chain to be given as above, we would need 
\begin{align*}
&\alpha_i P_{ij}=\alpha_j P_{ji}^*\\
&\alpha_i \frac{\pi_i}{\sum_j \pi_j}=\alpha_1 \pi_i\\
&\alpha_i=\alpha_1 P(X \geq i)\\
&1=\sum_i \alpha_i=\alpha_1 E[X]; \alpha_i=\frac{P(X \geq i)}{E[X]}, 
\end{align*}
where $X$ is the inter arrival time. We need to verify that $\alpha_i P_{i,i+1}=\alpha_{i+1}P^*_{i+1,i}$ or equivalently $P(X \geq i)(1-\frac{\pi_i}{P(X \geq i)})=P(X \geq i)$ to complete the proof that the reversed process is the excess process and the limiting distributions are as given above. But that is immediate.


%\subsection{Time Reversibility for CTMC}
%\begin{prop}
%Markov property holds going backward in time. i.e.
%\begin{equation*}
%Pr(X(t-s)=j|X(t)=i,X(y), y > t)=Pr(X(t-s)=j|X(t)=i).
%\end{equation*}
%\begin{proof}
%\begin{align*}
%&Pr(X(t-s)=j|X(t)=i, X(y), y>t)=\frac{Pr(X(t-s)=j, X(t)=i, X(y), y>t)}{Pr(X(t)=i, X(y), y>t)}\\
%&\stackrel{(a)}{=}\frac{Pr(X(t-s)=j)Pr(X(t)=i|X(t-s)=j)Pr(X(y), y>t|X(t)=i)}{Pr(X(t)=i, X(y), y>t)}\\
%&\stackrel{}{=}\frac{Pr(X(t-s)=j)Pr(X(t)=i|X(t-s)=j)}{Pr(X(t)=i)}\\
%&\stackrel{}{=}Pr(X(t-s)=j|X(t)=i).\\
%\end{align*}
%where $(a)$ follows from the Markov property of forward chain.  
%\end{proof}
%\end{prop}
%Now we would like to characterize the sojourn time in each state. Since the amount of time spent in each state is same whether in forward or backward direction, one expects the sojourn time for the reverse chain to be exponential with the same parameter $\nu_i$. We can verify this formally:
%\begin{align*}
%&Pr(\text{Process in state i during [t-s,t]}|X(t)=i)\\
%&= {Pr(\text{Process in state i during [t-s,t]})}/{Pr(X(t)=i)}\\
%&= \frac{Pr(X(t-s)=i)e^{-\nu_i s}}{Pr(X(t)=i)}=e^{-\nu_i s}.\\
%\end{align*}
%Next, we would like to characterize the transition probabilities of the reversed chain. The sequence of states visited by the reverse process constitutes a discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities $P_{ij}^*$ give by 
%\begin{equation}
%P_{ij}^*= \frac{\pi_jP_{ji}}{\pi_i},
%\end{equation} 
%where $\{\pi_i,~ i \geq 0\}$ are the stationary probabilities of the embeddede discrete time Markov chain with transition probabilities $P_{ij}$. Denote 
%\begin{equation}
%q_{ij}^*=\nu_iP_{ij}^*
%\end{equation}
%as the infinitesimal rates of the reversed process. Using the previous formula for $P_{ij}^*$ we see that
%\begin{equation}
%q_{ij}^*=\frac{\nu_i\pi_jP_{ji}}{\pi_i}.
%\end{equation} 
%Recall that 
%\begin{equation}
%P_{k}=\frac{\pi_k / \nu_k}{\sum_{i}\pi_i / \nu_i},
%\end{equation}
%we see that 
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\pi_i}{\pi_j}=\frac{\nu_j P_j}{\nu_i P_i}.
%\end{equation}
%Hence, 
%\begin{equation}
%q_{ij}^*=\frac{\nu_j P_{j}P_{ji}}{P_i}= \frac{P_jq_{ji}}{P_i}.
%\end{equation}
%That is,
%\begin{equation*}
%P_{i}q_{ij}^*=P_{j}q_{ji}.
%\end{equation*}
%Form the above equation, it is obvious that 
%\begin{equation*}
%\sum_{i}P_i q_{ij}^*=0.
%\end{equation*} 
%This implies that $P_j,~j \geq 0$ are the stationary probabilities for the reverse chain as $P_j$s satisfy the balance equations.
%%\begin{defn}
%A stationary CTMC is said to be time reversible if the reverse process follows the same probabilistic law as the original process. That is, if, for all $i,j$
%\begin{equation*}
%q_{ij}^*= q_{ij} \iff P_{i}q_{ij}=P_jq_{ji}.
%\end{equation*} 
%%\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}[The M/M/1 queue]
The M/M/1 queue is the simplest and most studied models of queueing systems. In this continuous-time model, arrivals to a single-server queue occur according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$. There
is one line (queue) to wait in, and customers independently (and independent of the
Poisson arrival process) have service times $\{S_n\}_{n}$ that are exponentially distributed at rate $\mu$. We assume that customers join the tail of the queue, and hence begin service in the order that they arrive {\em first-in-queue-first-out} (FIFO). Let $X(t)$ denote the number of customers in the system at time $t \in \R$, where ``system"
means the queue plus the service area. So (for example), $X(t) = 2$ means that there
is one customer in service and one waiting in line. Note that a transition can only
occur at customer arrival or departure times, and that departures occur whenever
a service completion occurs. At an arrival time,  $X(t)$ jumps up by the amount 1,
whereas at a departure time $X(t)$ jumps down by the amount 1. (courtesy Karl Sigman's lecture notes, \url{http://www.columbia.edu/~ks20/stochastic-I/stochastic-I-CTMC.pdf})

Given this description, one can argue that $\{X(t)\}_t$ is a CTMC, on the state space $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$, with rate matrix ... FIXME

\subsection{Simple Queues}
\begin{cor} 
Number of customers in a simple M/M/1 queue at equilibrium is a reversible Markov process.
\end{cor}

\begin{thm}[PASTA] Poisson arrivals see time averages.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Little's law] Consider a stable single server queue. Let $T_i$ be waiting time of customer $i$, $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, and $A(t)$ be the number of customers that entered system in duration $[0,t)$, then
\begin{align*}
\lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{\int_{0}^tN(u)du}{t} &= \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{A(t)}T_i}{A(t)}.
\end{align*} 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $A(t), D(t)$ respectively denote the number of arrivals and departures in time $[0,t)$. Then, we have 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{D(t)}T_i \leq \int_{0}^tN(u)du \leq \sum_{i=1}^{A(t)}T_i.
\end{align*}
Further, for a stable queue we have
\begin{align*}
\lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{D(t)}{t} = \lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{A(t)}{t}.
\end{align*}
Combining these two results, the theorem follows.
\end{proof}

%\begin{cor}
%Consider an M/M/s queue with Poisson$(\lambda)$ arrivals and each server having exponential service time $\exp(\mu)$ service. If $\lambda > s \mu$, then the output process in steady state is Poisson$(\lambda)$.
%\end{cor}
%\begin{proof}
%Let $X(t)$ denote the number of customers in the system at time $t$. Since M/M/s process is a birth and death process, it follows from the previous proposition that $\{X(t),~t \geq 0\}$ is time reversible. Now going forward in time, the time instants at which $X(t)$ increases by 1 are the arrival instants of a Poisson process. Hence, by time reversibility, the time Points at which $X(t)$ increases by 1 when we go backwards in time also constitutes a Poisson process. But these instants are exactly the departure instants of the forward process. Hence the result.

\begin{exmp*}[Two queues with joint waiting room] Consider two independent M/M/1 queues with arrival and service rates $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ respectively for $i \in [2]$. Then, joint distribution of two queues is
\begin{align*}
\pi(n_1,n_2) &= (1 -\rho_1)\rho_1^{n_1}(1-\rho_2)\rho_2^{n_2},~~n_1,n_2 \in \N_0. 
\end{align*}
Suppose both the queues are sharing a common waiting room, where if arriving customer finds $R$ waiting customer then it leaves. In this case,
\begin{align*}
\pi(n_1,n_2) &= (1 -\rho_1)\rho_1^{n_1}(1-\rho_2)\rho_2^{n_2},~~(n_1,n_2) \in A \subseteq \N_0\times\N_0. 
\end{align*}

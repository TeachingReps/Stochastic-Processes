\section{Motivation}
Demonetization of high value currencies has led to financial crisis in India recently. It has obviously caused variation in consumption trends. We would like to characterize these variations over time using stochastic processes.
\section{System Model}
We could find consumption being modeled as a random walk process in literature. We intend to use this model as well as try finding better suiting models for consumption which will be affected by demonetization and study the behavior over time.  
\section{Problem Statement}
Attempt to model consumption as a stochastic process and characterize its variations over time due to demonetization


\section{Plan}
Week 1-2: Literature survey -To understand how consumption is modeled as different stochastic processes and demonetization as a disturbance\newline
Week 3-4: Attempting to find a metric to the economy has stabilized after a sudden disturbance like demonetization\newline
Week 5-6: Summarizing results

\section{Motivation}
Random Networks arise when nodes are randomly spread on the plane and connected randomly according to some rule which in most of the cases gives a structure that resembles many real natural systems as well as artificial complex systems.
\section{System Model}
The model assumes that each node is in a stochastic motion independent of the motion of other every other node. We assume that nodes can detect other nodes within distance $r$. 
\section{Problem Statement}
Consider the model in which nodes are initially distributed according to a Simple Point Process with intensity $\lambda$ over $\mathbb{R}^2$ and are moving in continuous time according to some Stochastic Process (will mention later). We show that there exists a sufficiently large value of $\lambda$ such that the target will eventually be detected almost surely.
\subsection{Justification}
As compared to the existing literature the problem is very trivial and thus our target is to solve the problem with much simpler techniques.

\section{General guide lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Understanding Brownian Motion.
\item Try and verify whether the theorems regarding Brownian motion are valid for Standard Normal.
\item Decide the type of Stochastic motion of the nodes to be dealt with.
\end{itemize}
